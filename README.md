## 🧠 What is Caesar Cipher?

The Caesar Cipher is one of the oldest known encryption techniques.  
It works by shifting each letter in a message by a fixed number of positions in the alphabet.

For example, with a shift of `+3`:
- A → D  
- B → E  
- Z → C  

Decryption reverses this shift to reveal the original message.
